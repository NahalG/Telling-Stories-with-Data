# Transforming Education with ChatGPT

## The Final Story 

If I were to pitch my final narrative in a minute’s time, it would be: 

‘Hi everyone! Today I will be talking about ChatGPT and the need to educate our students about it. ChatGPT was launched in November 2022. Despite being banned in seven countries, it was able to reach a 100 million users in two months. ChatGPT has taken the world by storm. Many speculate that there is a correlation between the tech layoffs and the launch of ChatGPT, but it is relatively soon to comment on that. However, there have been an influx of investment in AI by these tech companies which mean new job roles (a sigh of relief for graduating students) BUT these jobs will require AI skills. Therefore, it is the responsibility of academia to help students develop these future-fit skills by teaching them rather than banning them. ChatGPT can revolutionize the way we approach education. In order to unleash the power of learning through AI, log onto the platform and explore.’

## The Narrative

The launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 took the world by storm. ChatGPT revolutionized the way we interacted with machines and how we approached different aspects of personal and professional life. However, this groundbreaking technology came amidst a wave of tech layoffs which shook the industry and leaving many wonder whether the future of jobs. As a final year graduate student, I wondered what the future of work will be and if our skills would really be required. My curiosity pushed me to explore the realm of ChatGPT and use this topic as the thesis of my final project for a course (Telling Stories with Data) at Heinz College. 

This project was divided into three parts. The first part of the project required to develop an initial storyline which would capture the attention of my target audience. The initial narrative I developed was title ‘Human Race Against ChatGPT’ which explored the realms what ChatGPT is, is there a correlation between its launch and tech layoff and that we should train our students in this field. In order to support the story with data, I went on to searching and collecting data. Given this was a newly trending event, there were very little data points. However, I scraped off data from website and developed a dataset to analyze using Tableau and Flourish. After building the dataset, I developed rudimentary sketches of graphs to bolster the storyline. Part of one of the project is linked [here](https://nahalg.github.io/Telling-Stories-with-Data/FinalProjectpart1). 

The second part of the project focused on revisiting the first and developing wireframes, storyboards and conducting user research. I decided to build my wireframe on Shorthand. For this project I was adamant on keeping tech industry like aesthetics that is shades of blue, black, green, and purple. I had included a number of designs and styles to test on the user during user research. I had used videos to test if the user would interact with it. I conducted user research by interviewing three individuals and one focus group to gauge feedback about the wireframe. The user feedback gave me key insights which I might have missed otherwise. Part of two of the project is linked [here](https://nahalg.github.io/Telling-Stories-with-Data/Finalprojectpart2.html).

The third part or the [final story](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/transformingeducationwithchatgpt/) of the project was the most critical. Based upon the feedback received from the user research and the professor, I edited my storyline to make it more crisp for the audience. I felt that in part two, I digressed from the initial storyline due to which the call to action was lost in the narrative. While revamping my narrative, I added catchy titles, added a section on the investments in this field, advantages and disadvantage of ChatGPT in education, cleaned up the aesthetics to a single theme of shade of blue and black, added a clear call to action and signposted resources as call to action and removed all videos.I feel my biggest challenge during this part was designing a graph which would be able to show the impact of ChatGPT achieving 100 million users in two months as compared to other platform which grew slowly. I feel I was able to show this using the moving line graph.  

## The audience

When I started working on this project, I thought my direct target audience will be my peers who I will be presenting to. Therefore, I sketched out the narrative according to that. When I developed the wireframe and conducted user research, the respondent said that the target audience could be general public. It was then I reexamined who my target audience could be and how the narrative or call to action would vary accordingly. The target audience for my final story were students, academia, policymakers and the general public. 

## Final thoughts

Working on this project over the past three weeks has been fun and rewarding. As I built this project from scratch, I was able to learn the art of data visualization using Flourish and Tableau – two tools I had never used before. It was interesting to see how the same data has the power to narrate a different story depending upon the data visualization you choose. While working on this project, my biggest challenge was that I would sometimes end up spending too much time on exploring tools and the aesthetics of the final story. In the end, I had to apply the concept of value vs feasibility to my task to prevent me from digressing to much from the subject. I feel that this project not only equipped me with the technical tools but also taught me the art narrating a story through powerful data visualizations. All in all, it was rewarding to see my initial ideas come to fruition and to delve into the world of ChatGPT.
