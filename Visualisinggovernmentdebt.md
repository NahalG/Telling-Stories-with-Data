## Line Graph
The chart below shows the Government Debt to GDP ratio across different countries. I have used multiple line graphs to showcase these trends.

## Scatter:Beeswarm

The Beeswarm plot below visualizes the governmentâ€™s Debt to GDP ratio from 1995 to 2019 across different countries. I selected this graph type as it allows the reader to track the economic conditions of country over the years. While designing this chart, I used dots to depict the ratio for a given country in a given year and used three colors to shade these dots: grey, purple, and green. The dots shaded dark purple (which appears to be alarming) depicts the country with the highest debt to GDP ratio whereas the green (which is associated with positivity) depicts the lowest debt to GDP ratio. All other are shaded grey to avoid a rainbow effect and shed focus on the highest and lowest ratios. The shades gey and green were picked from the color palette available on coolors.co. The size of the dots varies with the size of the debt to GDP ratio. I have also added a filter for country in case the user wants to just look at a given country. The labels and chart heading are bold and black to give a crisp look. The Y-axis is alphabetically sorted so it is easier to find countries. I have added the logo in the header to show that the data is taken from a reliable source and have added the source link in the footer to avoid plagiarism and in case anyone want to deep-dive into the data or check the authenticity of the data. A footer note has been added to alert the reader that each dot represents a variable which is the percentage of the GDP.
