# Critque By Design 

## Introduction
Coming from a developing country which lacks the basic infrastructure, funding, and skillset to provide good quality healthcare to masses especially women, I am always inquisitive to know how successful the initiatives by World Health Organization (WHO) are when it come women’s health. Therefore, I decided to review a data visualization chart for Maternal Mortality Ratio. 


## Maternal Mortality Ratio - A WHO Report Data Visualization 
The visualization below was taken from [WHO Health Statistics 2022 Report](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240051157) (page 22) and the data was scraped from the corresponding statistics guide – [Trends in Maternal Mortality](https://www.unfpa.org/featured-publication/trends-maternal-mortality-2000-2017) (Annex 7, page 79).

Interpreting this data visualization in isolation of the qualitative data outlined in the report, one might ponder as to what story does this visualization really aims at narrating. The chart lacks a crisp title which indicate what the purpose of the graph is. However, after perusing through it closely, the viewer is able to identify that it showcases a decline in maternal mortality ratio in WHO regions and the world. The chart appears heavy due to excessive gridlines, curved bar charts and inconsistent aesthetics (shape of bars and labeling).
