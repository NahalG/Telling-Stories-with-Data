# Critque By Design 

## Introduction
Coming from a developing country which lacks the basic infrastructure, funding, and skillset to provide good quality healthcare to masses especially women, I am always inquisitive to know how successful the initiatives by World Health Organization (WHO) are when it come women’s health. Therefore, I decided to review a data visualization chart for Maternal Mortality Ratio. 


## Maternal Mortality Ratio - A WHO Report Data Visualization 
The visualization below was taken from [WHO Health Statistics 2022 Report](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240051157) (page 22) and the data was scraped from the corresponding statistics guide – [Trends in Maternal Mortality](https://www.unfpa.org/featured-publication/trends-maternal-mortality-2000-2017) (Annex 7, page 79).

The target audience for this data visualization is internal WHO stakeholders, policymakers,government agencies, non-governmental organizations, members of public interested and working in the field of Health.

This visualization showcases the maternal mortality ratios for the year 2000 and 2017. I feel that the colors are well controlled in this chart by using two colors to distinguish between years alongside a legend to indicate the correlation between the color scheme and year. Each bar in the graph clearly states the maternal mortality ratio which made it easy to read the chart. The source of data is also mentioned which signals that the data is authentic. Another positive point about this chart is that all countries are placed next to one another alphabetically and horizontally which makes it easy to compare between them.

Interpreting this data visualization in isolation of the qualitative data outlined in the report, one might ponder as to what story does this visualization really aims at narrating. The chart lacks a crisp title which indicates the purpose of the graph. However, after perusing through it closely, the viewer is able to identify that it showcases a decline in maternal mortality ratio in WHO regions and the world. The chart appears heavy due to excessive gridlines, curved bar lines and inconsistent aesthetics (shape of bars and labeling). 


## Brainstorming & Re-iterating Data Visualisation

After interpreting the chart, I placed myself in the shoes of the target audience and tried to recreate a visualization which would easily communicate the message without the need for supplement qualitative information. Therefore, I decided to recreate it the form of a line graph.

I sketched the above graph using the data to showcase the trends over the span of seventeen years. The ideology behind using a line graph was to trace the trend over a period of time rather than at merely just two instances (i.e. in 2000 and 2017). This graph makes it easy for the viewer to decipher the trend at the first glance and understand that maternal mortality is declining. Given I was sketching, I used different colors for every country to distinguish between countries. I added a title to specify what the chart showcases.
