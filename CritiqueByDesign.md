# Critque By Design 

## Introduction
Coming from a developing country which lacks the basic infrastructure, funding, and skillset to provide good quality healthcare to masses especially women, I am always inquisitive to know how successful the initiatives by World Health Organization (WHO) are when it come women’s health. Therefore, I decided to review a data visualization chart for Maternal Mortality Ratio. 


## Maternal Mortality Ratio - A WHO Report Data Visualization 
This visualization was taken from WHO Health Statistics 2022 Report (page 22) and the data was scraped from the corresponding statistics guide – [Trends in Maternal Mortality](https://www.unfpa.org/featured-publication/trends-maternal-mortality-2000-2017).
