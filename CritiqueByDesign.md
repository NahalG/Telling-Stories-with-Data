# Critque By Design 

## Introduction
Coming from a developing country which lacks the basic infrastructure, funding, and skillset to provide good quality healthcare to masses especially women, I am always inquisitive to know how successful the initiatives by World Health Organization (WHO) are when it come women’s health. Therefore, I decided to review a data visualization chart for Maternal Mortality Ratio. 


## Maternal Mortality Ratio - A WHO Report Data Visualization 
The visualization below was taken from [WHO Health Statistics 2022 Report](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240051157) (page 22) and the data was scraped from the corresponding statistics guide – [Trends in Maternal Mortality](https://www.unfpa.org/featured-publication/trends-maternal-mortality-2000-2017) (Annex 7, page 79).

The target audience for this data visualization is internal WHO stakeholders, policymakers,government agencies, non-governmental organizations, members of public interested and working in the field of Health.

This visualization showcases the maternal mortality ratios for the year 2000 and 2017. I feel that the colors are well controlled in this chart by using two colors to distinguish between years alongside a legend to indicate the correlation between the color scheme and year. Each bar in the graph clearly states the maternal mortality ratio which made it easy to read the chart. The source of data is also mentioned which signals that the data is authentic. Another positive point about this chart is that all countries are placed next to one another alphabetically and horizontally which makes it easy to compare between them.

Interpreting this data visualization in isolation of the qualitative data outlined in the report, one might ponder as to what story does this visualization really aims at narrating. The chart lacks a crisp title which indicates the purpose of the graph. However, after perusing through it closely, the viewer is able to identify that it showcases a decline in maternal mortality ratio in WHO regions and the world. The chart appears heavy due to excessive gridlines, curved bar lines and inconsistent aesthetics (shape of bars and labeling). 


## Brainstorming & Re-iterating Data Visualisation
