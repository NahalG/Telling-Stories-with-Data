Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out direclty in Shorthand this week if you wish.

## User Research: Bringing in the external voice

After developing a wireframe using shorthand, I reached out to three potential users of this data and requested them to critique the narrative and data visualization. The interview questions were:

1.	Have you used ChatGPT?
2.	What do you think about the narrative? 
3.	Do the sections and call to action link?
4.	Are the graphs easy or difficult for you to interpret?
5.	What do you think about the aesthetics?
6.	Who is the target audience for this?
7.	What element(s) do you like/dislike?
8.	Is there anything that surprises or confuses you?
9.	What would you change or do differently?
10.	Do you have any other suggestions?


### The Raw Interview Data is as follows:

```
Interview #1: 
Name: Student A,
Age: Late 20’s 
```

1.	Have you used ChatGPT?
Nope!
2.	What do you think about the narrative? 
The narrative is about ChatGPT and how it affects the future of education. 
2.	Do the sections and call to action link?
I could draw the connection between the call to action, tech layoffs and the usage of the software.
3.	Are the graphs easy or difficult for you to interpret?
The graphs were pretty easy to understand except for the word cloud. 
4.	What do you think about the aesthetics?
The aesthetics are pretty cool, don’t have an issue with them. Some fonts didn’t match the background. Like I think they are small. 
5.	Who is the target audience for this?
Public in general 
6.	What element(s) do you like/dislike?
I didn’t like that one of the clippings used was for Buzzfeed. I feel that’s unreliable but that’s just my opinion. I didn’t like the word cloud for the occupational roles. The backgrounds are neat, they could be distracting for some, but I like them. The information is interesting, relevant, and trending these days. 
7.	Is there anything that surprises or confuses you?
The word cloud confuses me. 
8.	What would you change or do differently?
Change the word cloud graph.
9.	Do you have any other suggestions?
No 

```
Interview #2: 
Name: Student B,
Age: Mid 20’s 
```

‘It’s Cute – The cover page.”
1.	Have you used ChatGPT?
No.
3.	What do you think is the narrative? 
This is about ChatGPT, how it came to be and what it can do. It also mentions the tech layoffs and links it to ChatGPT’s launch. It then goes onto connect it with the education sector.
2.	Do the sections and call to action link?
Yeah, I can see a link. I feel that students need to be trained in how to use the new technology and more so work around it rather than against it. 
3.	Are the graphs easy or difficult for you to interpret?
The graphs are easy to interpret and very clear. It would be nice if you could add the logos on the dot line graph too.
4.	What do you think about the aesthetics?
The aesthetics are pretty cool, very tech specific. However, I feel that towards the call-to-action section the color scheme had changed a little.
5.	Who is the target audience for this?
Students, teachers, and policymakers
6.	What element(s) do you like/dislike?
I like that the viewer is kept engaged with the use of videos, images, and newspaper clippings. 
Dislike: Font, Maybe use something that resonates with the tech writing style.
7.	Is there anything that surprises or confuses you?
I’ve never used the Open AI platforms. It was surprising to see how a software can actually develop images based on the specifications given to them. 
8.	What would you change or do differently?
I think I would built a little on how the call to action can be incorporated in the education sector. It felt that it was left incomplete.
9.	Do you have any other suggestions? 
No
 
```
Interview #3: 
Name: Professional A,
Age: Late 20’s 
```

1. Have you used ChatGPT?
No.
3.	What do you think is the narrative?
This is about ChatGPT and how it works. There is some mention about the education and ChatGPT towards the end. But recalling it after scrolling through it, I remember the overview about the ChatGPT.
2.	Do the sections and call to action link?
For me the introduction on ChatGPT was very detailed and the emphasis on the education linkage was very little.
3.	Are the graphs easy or difficult for you to interpret?
Graphs were fine, easy to read except the map. The title was a little small and hidden so couldn’t tell at the first glance as to what it was.
4.	What do you think about the aesthetics?
Aesthetics are quite nice, really liked them. Btw did you use a template? Where is this presentation made?
5.	Thanks. Its shorthand. I used different images and even created some using Dall-E. Who is the target audience for this?
It gave a general overview about ChatGPT. I think good for someone who doesn’t know anything about it. So I guess the public. 
7.	What element(s) do you like/dislike?
I really liked the aesthetics and the flow of the narrative. I feel there is a lot of text on the slides at the start, maybe cut down into bullet points. It can definitely be reduced. 
8.	Is there anything that surprises or confuses you?
The map confused me at the first glance. Had I not questioned you about it, I wouldn’t have understood it. 
9.	What would you change or do differently?
I’d change the things I told you – map, reduce text to make it crisp and focus more on education sector. 
10.	Do you have any other suggestions?
None.
