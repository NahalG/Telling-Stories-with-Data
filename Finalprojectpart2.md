# Topic: The Human Race Against ChatGPT

# Wireframes / storyboards

Curious about future of education and workforce, I decided to work on the advent of ChatGPT and how it intersects with academia and employment. My initial concept of the narrative can be found [here](https://nahalg.github.io/Telling-Stories-with-Data/FinalProjectpart1). 

As I delved deeper into the topic, I was able to find a plethora of resources to build and bolster my narrative. In order to wireframe the narrative, I decided to use shorthand as it not only helped sketch out the story but visualize graphs and aesthetics side by side, thereby serving as a mood board. Also, given I had a visual sample, it made it easier for me to conduct user research and gauge feedback as the interviewees were easily able to navigate through the storyline, data visualizations and the aesthetics of the presentation. Link to [shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/C3Y2xR8s31TeE4YP). 

My storyline is as follows: 

1.	What is ChatGPT – general information and who are the founders.
2.	What can ChatGPT do? – Show a demo video (an element for user’s engagement with the presentation)
3.	Highlight its growth – Use map to show regions where it doesn’t exist, Dotted line to show 100 million user reach, and line graph to show revenue projection. 
4.	Rise of Tech Layoffs – Used newspaper headlines as screenshots to build the link between layoff and launch of ChatGPT, identified roles which will be eliminated due to ChatGPT using word-cloud graph, used a bar chart to show the lay-offs in the top 6 companies. 
5.	Emphasize that ChatGPT is here to stay – Google Vs Microsoft war, Bain and Open AI’s recent partnership; all this indicates where the investment is flowing and what the future will be.
6.	Call to Action: Given the current scenario teach students to be Tech smart and learn to live with it rather than against it, added a demo of Dall-E to show how images can be created (I created and used 4 images for this presentation).

# User research 

## Target audience

The target audience for this presentation is students, academic faculty, employers, and policymakers. In order to conduct user research, I first outlined who the wider target audience was. Once I was able to identify that, I narrowed it down by using soft contacts – individuals who were representative of the ideal target audience and were easy approachable. I reached out to them via email and text message and then conducted the interview over Zoom. 

In today’s day and age, where we are more than ever dependent on technology to simplify our lives, it is integral for academia and policymakers to provide resources which enable individuals to live and grow with the advances in technology rather than fight against it and slow down.  

## User Research: Bringing in the external voice

After developing a wireframe using shorthand, I reached out to three potential users of this data and requested them to critique the narrative and data visualization. The interview questions were:

1.	Have you used ChatGPT?
2.	What do you think about the narrative? 
3.	Do the sections and call to action link?
4.	Are the graphs easy or difficult for you to interpret?
5.	What do you think about the aesthetics?
6.	Who is the target audience for this?
7.	What element(s) do you like/dislike?
8.	Is there anything that surprises or confuses you?
9.	What would you change or do differently?
10.	Do you have any other suggestions?


### The Raw Interview Data is as follows:

```
Interview #1: 
Name: Student A,
Age: Late 20’s 
```

1.	Have you used ChatGPT?
Nope!
2.	What do you think about the narrative? 
The narrative is about ChatGPT and how it affects the future of education. 
2.	Do the sections and call to action link?
I could draw the connection between the call to action, tech layoffs and the usage of the software.
3.	Are the graphs easy or difficult for you to interpret?
The graphs were pretty easy to understand except for the word cloud. 
4.	What do you think about the aesthetics?
The aesthetics are pretty cool, don’t have an issue with them. Some fonts didn’t match the background. Like I think they are small. 
5.	Who is the target audience for this?
Public in general 
6.	What element(s) do you like/dislike?
I didn’t like that one of the clippings used was for Buzzfeed. I feel that’s unreliable but that’s just my opinion. I didn’t like the word cloud for the occupational roles. The backgrounds are neat, they could be distracting for some, but I like them. The information is interesting, relevant, and trending these days. 
7.	Is there anything that surprises or confuses you?
The word cloud confuses me. 
8.	What would you change or do differently?
Change the word cloud graph.
9.	Do you have any other suggestions?
No 

```
Interview #2: 
Name: Student B,
Age: Mid 20’s 
```

‘It’s Cute – The title page.'
1.	Have you used ChatGPT?
No.
3.	What do you think is the narrative? 
This is about ChatGPT, how it came to be and what it can do. It also mentions the tech layoffs and links it to ChatGPT’s launch. It then goes onto connect it with the education sector.
2.	Do the sections and call to action link?
Yeah, I can see a link. I feel that students need to be trained in how to use the new technology and more so work around it rather than against it. 
3.	Are the graphs easy or difficult for you to interpret?
The graphs are easy to interpret and very clear. It would be nice if you could add the logos on the dot line graph too.
4.	What do you think about the aesthetics?
The aesthetics are pretty cool, very tech specific. However, I feel that towards the call-to-action section the color scheme had changed a little.
5.	Who is the target audience for this?
Students, teachers, and policymakers
6.	What element(s) do you like/dislike?
I like that the viewer is kept engaged with the use of videos, images, and newspaper clippings. 
Dislike: Font, Maybe use something that resonates with the tech writing style.
7.	Is there anything that surprises or confuses you?
I’ve never used the Open AI platforms. It was surprising to see how a software can actually develop images based on the specifications given to them. 
8.	What would you change or do differently?
I think I would built a little on how the call to action can be incorporated in the education sector. It felt that it was left incomplete.
9.	Do you have any other suggestions? 
No
 
```
Interview #3: 
Name: Professional A,
Age: Late 20’s 
```

1. Have you used ChatGPT?
No.
3.	What do you think is the narrative?
This is about ChatGPT and how it works. There is some mention about the education and ChatGPT towards the end. But recalling it after scrolling through it, I remember the overview about the ChatGPT.
2.	Do the sections and call to action link?
For me the introduction on ChatGPT was very detailed and the emphasis on the education linkage was very little.
3.	Are the graphs easy or difficult for you to interpret?
Graphs were fine, easy to read except the map. The title was a little small and hidden so couldn’t tell at the first glance as to what it was.
4.	What do you think about the aesthetics?
Aesthetics are quite nice, really liked them. Btw did you use a template? Where is this presentation made?
5.	Thanks. Its shorthand. I used different images and even created some using Dall-E. Who is the target audience for this?
It gave a general overview about ChatGPT. I think good for someone who doesn’t know anything about it. So I guess the public. 
7.	What element(s) do you like/dislike?
I really liked the aesthetics and the flow of the narrative. I feel there is a lot of text on the slides at the start, maybe cut down into bullet points. It can definitely be reduced. 
8.	Is there anything that surprises or confuses you?
The map confused me at the first glance. Had I not questioned you about it, I wouldn’t have understood it. 
9.	What would you change or do differently?
I’d change the things I told you – map, reduce text to make it crisp and focus more on education sector. 
10.	Do you have any other suggestions?
None.

```
Focus Group: Consisted of two CMU students, 
Age: Mid 20's
```
1. What Worked?
The topic is very interesting, the use of news-clippings
2. What didn't work?
The subtitle of the presentation 
3. What questions came up?
Can use of ChatGPT be detected ? what are the ways of challenging that system?
Ways that ChatGPT should not be used?
4. What new inspiration arose?
Maybe title page could have a pictire of a computer staring at a starting line, what are the new jobs which will be created.


## Interview findings

Having conducted three one-on-one interviews and one focus group in the class, I was able to gather some insightful feedback which is likely to help refine my project. The project theme about ChatGPT, Tech layoffs and the impact on education was well received and the interviewees found it very interesting since they had not interacted with this technology before. The interviewees found the aesthetics to be cool and in sync with the whole tech theme. Most of the graphs were easy to understand except for word cloud and the map. 

The interviewees felt that too much emphasis was give on the background of ChatGPT and a little on the call to action. They felt that it needed to be given more emphasis. There was feedback about the font – would be better to increase the size or change it. I feel the feedback on the graphs was critical as they are an integral feature of the presentation. 

### Aha Moments: 
1.	Aesthetics are quite nice, really liked them. Btw did you use a template? Where is this presentation made?
2.	It’s Cute – The title page.
3.	The information is interesting, relevant, and trending these days. 

# Identified changes for Part III

As I work towards designing the final version of this project, I will make the following changes: 
1.	Fix the word cloud and map charts.
2.	Align font and color scheme through out the presentation. 
3.	Shed more focus on the call to action by adding in elements/anecdotes.
4.	Reduce text heavy slides.
5.	Add logos on the dotted line graph. 
6.	Rework the graphics for backgrounds and images.
