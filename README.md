#Telling-Stories-with-Data
This repository contains my portfolio for Telling stories with data, a course I have taken at Carnegie Mellon University while pursuing a Masters in Public Policy and Science. 

#About Me
Hi! My name is Nahal Abdul Ghaffar (Pronouns are she/her). I am a second year Masters of Science in Public Policy and Management student at Heinz College (Carnegie Mellon University). I am from Karachi, Pakistan. 


#What I hope to learn
Data visualisation is prevalent in all faucets of life. Today, as we are inundated with data, it is integral to depict it visually to narrate the story and manuever our target audience's attention towards the story we wish to tell. As I navigate through this course, I hope to learn the art of using colors and the right tools to depict data which would create the biggest impact on the viewer. I also want to delve into the nuances of how an individual goes about building a narrative/story around a given data set and how much of information should be disbursed. I feel working through the different assignments and projects will give me a first-hand experience on these themes.  

Portfolio
